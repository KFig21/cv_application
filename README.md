I cant figure out how to get my react app on github. Im starting to feel like I'm not meant to be a programmer if i can't solve little problems like this

git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
